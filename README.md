<summary> What are CanaryTokens ? </summary>
<br/>
  
Canary tokens, also known as honeytokens, are not new but can be useful as a source of information. They can be understood as unique identifiers that can be embedded in different places. If they are touched, an alert is triggered.

<summary> What is Pseudonymity ? </summary>
<br/>
  
Anonymity means that an individual dealing with an APP entity cannot be identified and the entity does not collect personal information or identifiers. A pseudonym is a name, term or descriptor that is different to an individual's actual name.
  
Pseudonymity is the near-anonymous state in which a user has a consistent identifier that is not their real name: a pseudonym.

### Security , Vulnerability, Threats and Adversaries 

### Confidentiality , Integrity and Availability - (Security Attributes)

These three letters stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, otherwise known as the CIA triad. Together, these three principles form the cornerstone of any organization's security infrastructure; in fact, they (should) function as goals and objectives for every security program.

Confidentiality

Data should be handled based on the organization's required privacy.
Data should be encrypted using 2FA.
Keep access control lists and other file permissions up to date.

Integrity

Ensure employees are knowledgeable about compliance and regulatory requirements to minimize human error.
Use backup and recovery software.
To ensure integrity, use version control, access control, security control, data logs and checksums.

Availability

Use preventive measures such as redundancy, failover and RAID. Ensure systems and applications stay updated.
Use network or server monitoring systems.
Ensure a data recovery and business continuity (BC) plan is in place in case of data loss.




### The Zero Trust Model 

The Zero Trust model recognizes that trust is a vulnerability. Once on the network, users – including threat actors and malicious insiders – are free to move laterally and access or exfiltrate whatever data they are not limited to. ... Zero Trust is not about making a system trusted, but instead about eliminating trust.
