<summary> What is Pseudonymity ? </summary>
<br/>
  
Anonymity means that an individual dealing with an APP entity cannot be identified and the entity does not collect personal information or identifiers. A pseudonym is a name, term or descriptor that is different to an individual's actual name.
  
Pseudonymity is the near-anonymous state in which a user has a consistent identifier that is not their real name: a pseudonym.
